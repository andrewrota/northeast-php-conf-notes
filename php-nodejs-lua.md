## Service Oriented Architecture

HTTP Protocol.

"[Service Architecture] is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API." - Fowler

### RabbitMQ

Build event driven architecture.

### PHP

Once you have a SOLID set of API foundation you can easily start building other awesome applications.

They built an application using Silex in PHP.

### JavaScript (using Angular)

### Mobile

Went from stateful to stateless.  Removed server sessions and used sessions on the client with localstorage instead.

Implemented JSON Web Signature in PHP.

### Switched to NodeJS + Express

Express was a natural fit because templates were already written in Jade.

Why Node?

* Rapid application development
* Quick setup
* Event driven
* JavaScript!

Created mockserver to mock APIs

Created shisha for smoke tests

### Switched to Redis (from Memcached)

Has Lua built in as a scrpting language.

### What's next?

* HHVM
* elasticsearch
* docker

### Il mondo è bello perché è vario

Use the right tool

You can solve problems in different ways.
