# Lightning Critiques

**By Jason Mark @gravityswitch**

Good design is about intent

You go to a web page and give it only a few seconds whether you're going to use it.  Your goal is to keep the customer for two minutes.  It trickles down the chain and increases your week and two week return visits.

## Visual Hierarchy

* When you go to a page what do you look at first
* Usually you don't want a 'KMart Flier' where everything is big and you don't know where to look

## Target Audience

How do you make a site for many different audiences?  Create personas for each audience.  Make the home page not turn any audience off, but focus on your main audience.
